This is the source code for the personal webpage kevin074.github.io

The code was 100% implemented by me with minimal scaffolding from CRA. 

The majority portion of this web page is 100% typescript, some parts like the sorting algorithms started predated TS implementation

if you are a recruiter or team reviwer looking to see the level of programming skills, please look at the GO board game page and corresponding source code.

This board game is pretty complex and I implemented all the features necessary to play the game flawlessly.

I also paid for a designer to make prototype pictures for the website, this will be slowly updated.
