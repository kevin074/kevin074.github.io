		Mentality is affects programmers in a different way. The most infamous is god complexes since we are creators of observable and effects. It is really hard to not feel attached sometimes. However, we have to acknolwedge mistakes on our parts when reviewing code with others. We have to owe up to our responsbility when a bug in production is reported. We also have to be easy on others as to not act in effect to bloat our own egos. These are all impediments to improvements as the programmer become more preoccupied with defending credibility than anything else. Mentality is also important in opininos about certain technology. People tend to get heated online about which technology is better, such as mobx vs redux. The discussion degenerates very fast as opinions become more polarized. Having extreme opinions also means producing codes that are very opinionated. Such as having to do the code base in extreme object oriented way when minor codes, such as summing an array of numbers, can very well stay functional and not integrated into some utility object.
